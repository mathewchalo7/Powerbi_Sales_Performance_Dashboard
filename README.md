## 🗂 Project Tasks & Implementation

### **Part 1: Data Preparation & Feature Engineering**

#### **a) Data Integration**
- Performed a **LEFT JOIN** between Sales Transactions and Product Master to retain all transactions, including those with missing product records
- Performed an **INNER JOIN** with Customer Information to include only completed transactions with valid customers
- Performed a **LEFT JOIN** with Sales Representatives, retaining all transactions and flagging orphaned records
- Investigated and resolved the missing `CustomerID` in **TXN004** using transaction pattern analysis

#### **b) Data Cleaning & Standardization**
- Standardized all date formats across datasets
- Cleaned pricing columns by removing `$`, handling `#ERROR#` and `#N/A`, and converting values to decimal format
- Standardized Discount% values (treated blanks as 0%, converted percentages to decimals)
- Created a hierarchical **Territory structure**:  
  `Region → Territory → Sales Representative`
- Validated and standardized Channel names (case consistency and naming variations)
- Generated **Customer Segments** based on Company Size and Credit Limit

#### **c) Calculated Columns**
- Net Sale Amount  
- Gross Profit  
- Profit Margin %  
- Commission Amount  
- Days Since Launch
